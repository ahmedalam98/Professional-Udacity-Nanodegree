# UDACITY Front End Web Developer Projects

This repository contains project work for Udacity's Front-End Web Developer Nanodegree.

## What I have done in this nano degree:

- Mastered the skills required to become a Front-End Web Developer, and started building beautiful, responsive websites optimized for mobile and desktop performance.
- Learned the fundamentals of how the web works and gain a working knowledge of the three foundational languages that power each and every website: HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

## Projects I developed in this nanodegree:

1. landing Page
2. Weather Journal App
